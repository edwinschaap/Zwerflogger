A list of known issues.
Feel free to add issues.

- Apparently some scanners (at least Android Zxing's) prefetch the URL scanned. (They show the title of the page afterwards.) This prefetch is registered as the login, eventhough it's actually just a preview. Maybe show a page with a button to continue login instead of logging in directly.
- Logging in with just the teamid is not secure. Maybe add a PIN/password?
